# OverView of the Project

# - Opening background information
#   Recent advancements in AI recognition technology using cameras have made it a vital
#   research topic across nearly all fields. In particular, real-time facial measurement technology
#   serves as a foundational aspect of AI, playing an essential role in supporting various
#   applications. Facial detection technology can be widely applied, including in criminal detection,
#   ideal beauty assessment, and security, demonstrating high versatility in practical use.

# - General description of the current Project
#   Real-time facial detection within a webcam feed is a foundational project for applications,
#   offering broad versatility and applicability across all fields requiring facial recognition.

# - Proposed idea for enhancements to the project
#   As AI technology advances, accuracy and speed can improve proportionally, making its
#   future-oriented versatility a significant advantage.
    
# - Value and significance of this project
#   Since this technology will remain useful in the future, continuous improvements can
#   enhance its efficiency and accuracy, enabling the integration of high-performance
#   detection systems into compact hardware.

# - Current limitations
#   While it is only necessary to train the system primarily on human faces rather than a wide
#   range of data, clean and accurate data is essential for precise differentiation. Thus,
#   the process of filtering and categorizing data must involve either human intervention or
#   another AI. If humans handle this task, it can be time-consuming, and using another AI
#   requires the development of an additional model, which poses its own challenges.
#   Additionally, since a camera can only capture a flat, 2D representation, multiple
#   cameras may be necessary for a more three-dimensional assessment.
